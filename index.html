              Good design and good markup provide structure to content. Good markup is
              a fundamental part of good design: beautiful on the inside, beautiful on
              the outside. HTML and CSS give another venue to provide structure to
              content in the native language of the web, and learning these guides
              decisions by surfacing the affordances of the medium. Design decisions
              are affected by both the content and the format, like how a sculptor
              would make different decisions if she were working with clay rather than
              marble.</p>

              It’s important to realize that the web is an experiential medium. It’s 4D:
              there is change over time as users interact with the work. Still images of
              sites are no good, much like how a still from a movie only gives a faint
              sensation of what it is to see the film. The best pathway to achieve
              parity between the construction and final result is to learn markup and
              stylesheets for concepting and prototyping.</p>

              The skills needed to learn HTML and CSS are not far from those used by
              the print designer day to day. One only needs to take the time to learn
              the terms. HTML is a markup language that annotates content with tags that
              define hierarchy and structure. Print designers already do this when
              establishing typographic hierarchy. CSS applies aesthetic treatment to
              parts of the design based on the content’s classification. Print designers
              should be familiar with this behavior from using styles in software like
              InDesign and Illustrator.</p>

              The mental leap in coding HTML and CSS is to learn the particular tags
              necessary to define the structure, hierarchy, and aesthetics. My belief
             is that learning them is a short step if a designer already understands
            typographic hierarchy, knows nesting relationships from producing outlines,
            and grasps separating aesthetics from structure by way of Styles in other
            software.</p>

              To get started, I’d recommend watching a few videos at Don’t Fear the
               Internet, which offers a succinct introduction to HTML and CSS for the
                print designer. Don’t miss their resources page as well. Learning to
                 code is a leap, but it’s not as far as you think. Maybe it’s time
                  to become bilingual. </p>

                The puritan in me wants to say that HTML and CSS aren’t coding because
                they’re not programming languages, but markup and presentation
                semantics. For the sake of consistency, I’ve maintained the terminology
                of Adobe’s website and Walker’s tweet.</p>
